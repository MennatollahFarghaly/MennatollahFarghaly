## 🧠 About Me

🎓 Recent **Systems and Computer Engineering** graduate from Al-Azhar University (Class of 2025).  
🚀 Passionate about **cybersecurity**, **networking**, **embedded systems**, and **cloud infrastructure**.  
💡 I love building secure, connected systems — from low-level embedded devices to cloud-based telemetry dashboards.  

Currently:
- 💼 **Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessment Trainee** at DEPI  
- 🌐 Exploring **Blue Team Security**, **Cloud Fundamentals**, and **DevOps pipelines**  
- 🛰️ Leading development of a **2U CubeSat Mission Control System** (Graduation Project, EgSA Sponsored)

## 🛰️ Featured Projects

### 🔹 Mission Control Center (CubeSat)
**Stack:** STM32, LabVIEW, PostgreSQL, Django, ESP32-CAM, AI Models  
- Led a 5-member team to design and simulate a **2U CubeSat system** integrating real-time telemetry and remote control.  
- Implemented **UART-based telemetry** with LabVIEW visualization and offline PostgreSQL sync.  
- Deployed AI models for **fire and illegal-construction detection** via satellite imagery.

### 🔹 Web Application Penetration Testing – OWASP Juice Shop
**Tools:** Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, OWASP ZAP  
- Participated in vulnerability scanning and exploitation in a team environment.  
- Identified and documented a **PHP-based information disclosure** vulnerability.
